      [Good Morning, Church. My name is Alex, and I am the Area Conference Minister, for the Northeast Region, of the Southern New England Conference, of the United Church of Christ. On any given day, that can be a lot of different things, but primarily I like to say that I get to help congregations and clergy thrive. I have been working closely with your congregation since the day I began and I am thrilled beyond measure to finally be with you in person. 
       
      The Book of Isaiah - the prophet Isaiah - is one you may be somewhat familiar with. Or rather, you may have heard his name before. Haggai, on the other hand, may be new to you. The Book of Haggai - one of the minor prophets of the Hebrew Scriptures - is only two chapters long. And while I don't normally use two scriptures these two dovetail so well with one another, I just had to use them. You see, one of the move pivotal moments of Jewish history was the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians. After the temple was destroyed, the Jewish people were taken into captivity in Babylon. After a few generations away from their ancestral home, the new King of Babylon issues a decree saying the Jewish people could return to Jerusalem. But guess what happens? Not all of the Jewish exiles want to go back. Many - maybe most! - had never even been to Jerusalem. Babylon was their home now! Jerusalem was across a desert. Why go back? So the prophet Isaiah reminded them of God’s promise. Our God is the one who makes ways through the river. And now, God is going to make a way through the desert. Why? “I am about to do a new thing,” the prophet exclaims, “now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?” 
      Enter now the prophet Haggai. Many of the Jewish people have returned. They’ve trusted in God’s promise and what do they find? Rubble and ruin. “Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory?” the prophet proclaims. “How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?” The prophet names what most who returned must’ve thought and felt, looking upon rubble and decay, and without much collective memory to remember its splendor. 
       
      And yet. The prophet literally says “Yet.” That all may be true. It may look run down in your sight right now - YET - take courage. Take courage and work because I am with you and when I am you have nothing to fear. I’m editorializing a bit here, but tell me you can see that in the prophets words. I see you, God says through the prophet. I see all that you’re carrying as you consider what it might take to rebuild. I acknowledge how you’re feeling, and even your skepticism, but you need to do this. Not because I need it - because God needs it - but rather because the splendor of what will come will be greater than what once was. Let me say that again: the splendor of what will come, the prophet says in verse 9, will be greater than what once was. 
       
      You do not need me to cite statistics to you around the decline of Christendom in America. You do not need me to remind you that an ever increasing number of people identify as no particular religion. You don’t need me to remind you that we are somewhere down the stream of generational change for the Christian Church in America. You don’t need me to remind you, right? And that is to say nothing of the global COVID19 pandemic that has fundamentally altered the lifestyles and habits of those few who were still regularly going to church - whatever “regularly” even means any more. 
       
      And it cannot go unsaid: Many of the challenges our churches face are due to self-inflicted wounds. Postures of indifference and silence when the church still had a meaningful platform from which to speak, ministry that felt disconnected and even contemptuous of modern life, our changes to welcome all people coming later than it should have - all of it contributing to where we are today. 
       
      YET. Yet. “The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former” says the Lord. The work we do as the people of God to rebuild the Church for generations to come is not to recreate what was, but rather to build something that outshines that what once was. And I do not mean “outshine” in all the traditional metrics with which we’re used to counting. I do not mean outshining the past in material wealth, or physical church property size, or worship attendance, or new members, or Sunday School enrollment - that is not the splendor God is speaking of. In fact, if I was a betting man, I would say what God is preparing you to do as Nahant village church will likely not measure up to past splendor. When the Prophet Isaiah set the people back to Jerusalem, it was not to do what they have always done. “I am about to do a new thing!” the prophet said - “do you not perceive it?” You may not be able to see it or even imagine it all right now, but are you preparing your hearts for something new? I believe that the splendor that will outshine that which once was will be in the number of people who didn’t know that Church could welcome them, or stand up for them. The latter splendor will be in the ministries that look nothing like what we’ve done before yet are touching the lives of people who truly need and long for a Gospel of freedom and love. The latter splendor of the house we are to rebuild will make a real and tangible impact on people’s lives and our communities. “I am preparing to do a new thing - do you not perceive it?” 
       
      Each of us trusting that even when our eyes cannot perceive all of what will be built, even when our spirits feel daunted by the task, even when we fear that what we have to build with will not be received, God is preparing splendor for the Church that shall be greater than the former. And God needs each of us to take courage, fear not, and get to work. Won’t the church say Amen?

      [Siblings in Christ: I love the story of the Transfiguration. I know that some clergy skip over it - as we hear it every year on the last Sunday before Lent - but I preach on it every time. Historically, the writers of the lectionary - the three year cycle of biblical readings - placed it on the final Sunday before Lent to give us a glimpse of the Christ we follow into this somber and Holy season. It is a literal Mountaintop moment, meant to gird and strengthen us for the Lenten road ahead which leads to the cross. Truthfully, in years past, that was not the reason I stayed with this scripture. Yet, as I sat down to write this sermon for you, I found myself returning to that rationale. Not because we need this story to prepare us to step into Lent - even though it is just before us. But rather, because, in this moment in which we are living, we need it to remind us of how to respond and act in a world that suddenly feels pulled into fear, confusion, and uncertainty. I preach on it today because in it I see myself - indeed, I need to see myself - and I wonder if you might, too. 
       
      Upon first glance, it may be difficult to place ourselves in it. The story is so specific, and the supernatural elements so strong, it can be hard to find ourselves among Peter, James, and John, standing before Moses, Elijah, and the transfigured Christ. The story bends space and time, and defies logic. Yes, that is all true. But at its core, the story reminds us of the most fundamental Christian truth: When fear brings us to our knees, Christ reaches down and whispers “Get up and do not be afraid.” 
       
      Siblings in Christ: We are living in a time in which fear feels so palpable. From natural disasters, to gun violence, to war, to racism, to political and economic instability - fear is nearly inescapable on the television and in our newspapers. And that is to say nothing of the personal stories each and every one of us bring into this space and moment. The stories you may not see on TV, but play over and over again in our minds' eyes, known maybe only to us. And at times my fear has brought me to my knees - at one moment in despair, and the next in prayer. I wonder if you know that feeling? In truth, with all of that in mind, I find it easier and easier to see myself in this story of the transfiguration, paralyzed by uncertainty and worry, joining Peter, James and John, on their knees in fear. 
       
      While I long for a world in which the only thing that we have to fear is the glory of the transfigured Christ before us, I know that is unlikely and unrealistic. To live - to be human - is to be brought to our knees in fear at some point in our lives. Very likely multiple times in our lives. That is unavoidable. Being Christian, following Christ, will not inoculate us from fear, unfortunately. Rather, what I believe this story reminds us, is that to follow Christ is to find our way out of fear once we’ve been brought to our knees. While we cannot avoid some fear, whenever we find ourselves brought to our knees by it, we can look into the face of Christ - and all that is around us has faded away for a moment - and hear a voice declare to us “Get up and do not be afraid.” Whatever has caused us to fear, whatever has us frozen in place, Christ reaches down to every single one of us and offers us a hand up. Indeed, for me, that is the gift of our faith in moments such as these. That is the gift of following Christ when fear and worry takes over. The Christian life is not free from worry, hardship, or fear. It is not a free-pass from pain or grief. Rather, the gift of our faith is a God who meets us on our knees, offering a hand up, and reminding us: “Do not be afraid.” In a world in which any of the number of screens I pick up can show me images of pain and suffering, the one I set before my mind's eye whenever I'm overwhelmed, is that of the transfigured Christ, lovingly whispering that it is time to get up and learn how to not be afraid. And it’s the image I invite you to behold today. In light of all there might be to fear, let us fix our eyes on Christ, who longs to be our peace. 
       
      In moments such as this I think of the mothers I met in the city of Sderot, Israel - an Israeli town close to the border of Gaza. As you may know, Gaza has long been a site of conflict between Israelis and Palestians soldiers. The people of Sderot lived with daily reminders of this truth having to build playgrounds that could withstand a rocket. I remember sitting with them, in their homes, wondering where they got the strength to get out from under their fear. And it turns out for a long time they didn’t know how. Until they got up, and decided to do something. They realized that if they were afraid in Sderot, there must be mothers afraid in Gaza. too. So they found a way to make contact with those Palestinian mothers. They made calls, when possible, and they wrote notes of love and hope. They reached out to one another to say “I am afraid - and maybe you are too - but I want you to know that I love you.” Their neighbors didn’t like what they were doing. They certainly cut against the national narrative. And maybe, most strikingly, their act of defiant hope didn’t stop the fighting. But shaky knees and all, they found the courage to get up and do something. 
       
      I’ve talked a lot about fear this morning. Both the various fears we might carry in our hearts, and the ones we share collectively in our world. But there is yet still one fear, which we all share, that may be on your minds, but I haven’t mentioned yet. That is the fear of the future of our churches. As your Area Conference Minister, I have the privilege of working with over 100 congregations in the greater Boston area. Some of those congregations have hundreds of members and huge endowments. Others have 20 members and wonder how they’ll pay the bills in a few months. Most are somewhere in between. And yet, despite all of our differences, all of them are asking the same questions: Where are the people we used to see in the pews? Will they come back again? Will new people come? Why don’t the things we used to do seem to be making an impact anymore? What does our future hold? For the first time in a long time, all of our churches are asking similar questions and living with similar fears. In the face of all of those questions and those fears, it is easy to feel brought to our knees.
       
      Yet, just as with all of our fears, our God loving looks at us, overwhelmed and uncertain, reaches out a hand and says “Get up, and do not be afraid.” Get up because, despite the uncertainty, there is still work left for you to do. There is still ministry - down this mountain- that needs to happen. There are still people who need to taste, touch, and feel the Good News from you because the ways in which only you can help them do so. There are LGBTQ kids and their parents, who still live in fear that God doesn’t love them. They need you to get up and not be afraid. There are youth and elders alike, struggling with mental illness and isolation, who are afraid they are alone. They need you to get up and not be afraid. There are parents, overwhelmed with pressure and financial obligations. They need you to get up and not be afraid. There are siblings of color, afraid that our churches have nothing to say of comfort in the face of racism and violence. They need you to get up and not be afraid. I do not know all the ways and shapes and forms your ministry will take here in Dracut. And I know that there are real questions - as there are everywhere - of what our futures hold, but nonetheless, our God looks upon us and whispers. “Get up and do not be afraid” because there is ministry for us to do. Your sister congregations in the Northeast Association, and indeed the whole Southern New England Conference, join you in this holy work. None of us are alone. And so on this transfiguration Sunday, we get up and follow Christ down the mountain. We follow Christ into this season of Lent. We follow Christ out of these doors, off our screens, and into the world to minister in his name. Not because we are magically unafraid, but because it is through serving, loving, and ministering, and relieving others of their fear, we might discover something other than our fear. And maybe, before we know it, there is no room for fear anymore because our hearts have been overcome by hope, joy, and possibility. And through it, we might even transform this world, one act of love at a time. Trusting that no matter what we fear, Christ is there, offering a hand up, and leading us to our next ministry opportunity. Won’t the Church say Amen?
